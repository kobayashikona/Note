# Structure of a C++ Program

## Overrview

**keywords**:These keywords are used by language so that they are not available for re-defination or overloading. e.g.`return`
**identifier**:Identifiers' names are created by programmers to represent something meaningful to them. e.g.`main`
**operator**:e.g.`<<  >>  ::`
**punctuation**:e.g.`"" ; {}`
All those above are called syntax.
